# Data-Visualization-using-D3-interactivity

The objective of this project is to incorporate interactivity in D3 visualisations. I have created bar graphs using university food dataset.Added tooltip to show details of each bar.
I have incorporated sound in our bar graphs. To do that, we need to reference the tone.js library which is a javascript library very similar to D3 [uploaded a sound recorded video of this using Camtasia software]. In second part of this project I have visualized universityâ€™s food data using D3 and hierarchical maps in D3. Thus used javascript along with css styling for more interactive visualization.
